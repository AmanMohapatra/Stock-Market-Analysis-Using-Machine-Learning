# Stock-Market-Analysis-Using-Machine-Learning
This is a project to analyze stock market and to determine the best Machine Learning Algorithm to predict the future prices of a particular stock.
We used a dataset which consist of the stock prices from the last 10 years of Tesla Incorporation.

On that dataset, we implemented a list of basic Machine Learning Algorithms taking the date and closing price as parameters.
The Machine Learning Algorithms are:-
1. Simple Linear Regression.
2. Decision Tree Classification.
3. K-Nearest Neighbour

While we were using these Algorithms our Project Mentor advised us to use Neural Networks Which would give us more accurate answers. 
So we used 2 more Algorithms from Neural Networks:
1. Long Short Term Memory (LSTM)
2. Recurrent Long Short Term Memort (RLSTM)
